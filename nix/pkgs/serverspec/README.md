## Notes for updating

Build an apppriate Gemfile (by hand seems ok) then get into a `nix shell`:

```
$ nix shell nixpkgs#ruby nixpkgs#bundix
$ bundle lock
$ bundix
``
> bundix doesnt seem to honor --gemfile and similar flags since import of pkg fails unless gemfile and gemfile.lock are
> local to *.nix file generated by bundix

### Limitations

`bundle update` does not seem to work due to native gems wanting to build themselves during the update process. Why this
would be the case Im not sure.
